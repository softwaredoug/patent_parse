    abstract: "A pivot mechanism includes a base member configured to be coupled to a first element and a generally cylindrical rotating member configured to be coupled to a second element. An elongate pin extends through the base member and rotating member and defines a pivot axis. The rotating member is capable of rotating relative to the base member about the pivot axis. The elongate pin is movable in a direction generally parallel to the pivot axis between a secured position and a release position. In the secured position, the rotating member is prevented from rotating relative to the base member, and in the release position, the rotating member is permitted to rotate relative to the base member. The pivot mechanism may be incorporated into a scooter or a tricycle to provide different configurations thereof."

    abstract: "A robot system, a robot controller and a robot control method, by which a coordinated control of a plurality of robots can be taught while appropriately considering a positional deviation of each robot into consideration. A gripping misalignment of a first workpiece in a leading robot is detected, and then a first amount of correction for correcting the misalignment is calculated. Further, a gripping misalignment of a second workpiece in a following robot is detected, and then a second amount of correction for correcting the misalignment is calculated. In the coordinated control, a taught position/orientation of the leading robot is corrected based on the first amount of correction, and a taught position/orientation of the following robot is corrected based on both the first mount of correction and the second amount of correction."

    abstract: "Signals are received from audio pickup channels that contain signals from multiple sound sources. The audio pickup channels may include one or more microphones and one or more accelerometers. Signals representative of multiple sound sources are generated using a blind source separation algorithm. It is then determined which of those signals is deemed to be a voice signal and which is deemed to be a noise signal. The output noise signal may be scaled to match a level of the output voice signal, and a clean speech signal is generated based on the output voice signal and the scaled noise signal. Other aspects are described."
