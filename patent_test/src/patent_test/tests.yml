    abstract: "The disclosure relates to a 3D reconstruction method based on an on-site edge-cloud collaboration for a cultivated land. An edge-cloud collaborative computing architecture is used, such that the edge computing device performs advance calculations after image data is acquired. The edge computing device measures performances of itself and a cloud data center, and arranges and deploys multiple 3D reconstruction containers in the cloud data center for the 3D reconstruction. Multiple reconstruction containers in the cloud data center perform reconstruction tasks in parallel to quickly obtain 3D reconstruction results, and provide them to the edge computing device for retrieval and download. This method is mainly oriented to agricultural project monitoring scenes, to reduce reconstruction time and a data transmission amount of 3D models, in order to improve a response speed and a quality of 3D reconstruction results, for large-scale on-site monitoring, acceptance, and review purposes of agricultural projects."

    abstract: "Data storage operations, including content-indexing, containerized deduplication, and policy-driven storage, are performed within a cloud environment. The systems support a variety of clients and cloud storage sites that may connect to the system in a cloud environment that requires data transfer over wide area networks, such as the Internet, which may have appreciable latency and/or packet loss, using various network protocols, including HTTP and FTP. Methods are disclosed for content indexing data stored within a cloud environment to facilitate later searching, including collaborative searching. Methods are also disclosed for performing containerized deduplication to reduce the strain on a system namespace, effectuate cost savings, etc. Methods are disclosed for identifying suitable storage locations, including suitable cloud storage sites, for data files subject to a storage policy. Further, systems and methods for providing a cloud gateway and a scalable data object store within a cloud environment are disclosed, along with other features."
